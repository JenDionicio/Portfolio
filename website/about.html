                <h5> Engineer & Student</h5>
                <p>I am a junior at New York University, majoring in computer science. I am is passionate about problem-solving and creative thinking, which I discovered when I came up with ways to create mechanisms with basic tools. My love for Sciences came into life after being inspired by the Disney movie Big Hero 6. Throughout high school I became part of the Robotics team where I immersed myself in challenges that emphasized teamwork, leadership, programming, and mechanical building.

                    I am driven by my passion to learn and reinforce circumstances for unrepresented communities. I am inspired by my peers, mentors, and the collage of innovators who continue to transform communities with the usage of technology. I believe that the most powerful component of change is communicating through an abstract of minds.
